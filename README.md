## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ## Environment Variables

   This project uses a `.env.example` file to manage environment-specific variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and update the values as needed.

      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

      ### Example

      ```env
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPERBASE_URL = ''
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPERBASE_ANON_KEY = ''
      ```

      Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

2. Start the app

```bash
   npx expo start
```
